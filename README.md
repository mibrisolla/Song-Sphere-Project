# App name: Song Sphere
Team repository for CMP-280-86551 Software Engineering 

Song Sphere is a conceptual redesign and expansion of the Airbuds social music application. The goal of Song Sphere is to enhance shared music discovery by combining social interaction, listening activity, achievements, and real-time engagement features into a cohesive system design.

This repository contains the planning, requirements, and system designs developed to model Song Sphere at both the analysis and design levels.
The repository is organized into three main folders, each representing a phase of the system development lifecycle:

[Project Plan]

Contents include:
Project Schedule
(Outlines the timeline, milestones, and deliverables for the Song Sphere project.)

System Context Diagram
(Shows external actors and systems that interact with it.)

[System Requirements]

Contents include:

Use Case Diagrams
(Visual representations of system functionality and user interactions.)

Use Case Scenarios (Excel Sheet)
(Detailed descriptions of individual use cases, including actors, inputs, outputs, and main flows.)

System Sequence Diagrams 
(Show interactions between actors and the system for key use cases.)

Class Diagram 
(Identifies core domain classes, their attributes, operations, and relationships at a conceptual level.)


[System Design]


Contents include:
Updated System Sequence Diagrams (BCE)
(Sequence diagrams expanded with Boundary, Control, and Entity classes to reflect object-level interactions.)

Design-Level Class Diagram
(A more detailed class diagram that incorporates design decisions, responsibilities, and refined relationships.)

Statechart Diagram
(Models the lifecycle and state transitions of key system entities.)
